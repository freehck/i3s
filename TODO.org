* TODO Make refresh period configurable
* TODO Make support for timeouts
  Now all plugins are called every time while status
  refresh. Sometimes this is quite insane. F.e. we don't need to
  update time plugin more than one time per second. Even more: if user
  chooses another time format, that doesn't show seconds, it could
  even be called only every minute. So we need some kind of
  caching-expiration mechanism to decrease irrational CPU consuming.
